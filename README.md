# Dokuwiki-skip-entity
Creates monospaced text wihout converting entities

The syntax for this plugin is:  ``<text>``
Whatever is included inside the markup will be rendered literally.  This means that no other
formatting markup will work here.  For instance, ``**bold**`` will be rendered as **bold**.
