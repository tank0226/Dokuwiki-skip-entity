The syntax for this plugin is:  ``<text>``.  This is adapted from the markdown markup for code.
Whatever is included inside the markup will be rendered literally.  This means that no other
formatting markup will work here.  For instance,``**bold**``  will be rendered as **bold**.
If you want bold, then the bold has to be placed outside the skip-entity markup:
    **``bold``**
  
The initial purpose of this plugin is to by-pass the rendering of entities where required without having to delete
entities from the configuration files.
